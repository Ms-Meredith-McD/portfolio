# Meredith McDonald's Portfolio

## Description
The goal of this portfolio project is to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a position. I hope to highlight my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. 

This portfolio as of 12/19/2023 shows my skills with: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables as well as the results of our first class challenge which was to refactor a "client's" website to be more accessible by using semantic html as well as generally cleaning up the code.

Specifc Objectives:
1. Present my name, photo or avatar, and links to sections about myself, my work, and how to contact me
2. Clicking the navigation links scrolls to the corresponding section
3. Clicking on a link to a section about my work will scroll to the section with titled images of my applications
4. When the first application is presented, the application's image should be larger in size than the others
5. When the images of the other applications are clicked, the end user is taken to that deployed application
6. When the page is resized or viewed on various screens or devices, it has a responsive layout and adapts to the viewport
